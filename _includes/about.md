Hi! I currently work for [Intent HQ](https://www.intenthq.com/) as Head of Engineering, writing functional Scala by day and Rust by night. [I write for SitePoint about Ruby](https://www.sitepoint.com/author/nkleyn/), and I'm on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nathankleyn) and on [GitHub](https://github.com/nathankleyn). You can get in touch with me at _mail/at/nathankleyn.com_.
