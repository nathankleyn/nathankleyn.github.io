Hi! I currently work for [Portify](https://portify.co/) as the Head of Engineering, writing Ruby by day, and functional Rust and Scala by night. [I write for SitePoint about Ruby](https://www.sitepoint.com/author/nkleyn/), and I'm on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nathankleyn) and on [GitHub](https://github.com/nathankleyn). You can get in touch with me at _mail/at/nathankleyn.com_.
