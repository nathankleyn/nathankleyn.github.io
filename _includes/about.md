Hi! I currently work for [Intent HQ](https://www.intenthq.com/) as Head of Engineering, writing Scala and processing huge data with Spark. I am passionate about functional programming, and spend my evenings working with Rust, Ruby and Haskell. [I sometimes write for SitePoint.com about Ruby](https://www.sitepoint.com/author/nkleyn/). I'm @nathankleyn on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nathankleyn) and on [GitHub](https://github.com/nathankleyn). Want to get in touch with me? Simply email me at _mail/at/nathankleyn.com_.
