Hi! I currently work for [Townhouse](https://townhouse.co.uk/) as the Head of Software Development, writing Typescript by day, and Rust and Ruby by night. [I write for SitePoint about Ruby](https://www.sitepoint.com/author/nkleyn/), and I'm on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nathankleyn) and on [GitHub](https://github.com/nathankleyn). You can get in touch with me at _mail/at/nathankleyn.com_.
