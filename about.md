<p class="message">Want to get in touch with me? Simply email me at mail/at/nathankleyn.com</p>

Iâ€™m Nathan Kleyn, and I am a web developer hailing from the heart of London, UK.

I currently work for UK based web-startup [Intent HQ](http://intenthq.com), and spend my days spreading the Ruby and Haskell love. I also work with Rust, IO, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and consider myself an expert user of Git. I have a keen interest in functional programming, and exploring algorithms and data structures in this paradigm.

You can find me in various places around the internet:

* On **Twitter**, I'm [@nathankleyn](https://twitter.com/nathankleyn). I tweet about random things, sometimes code sometimes not!
* Find me on **GitHub** as [nathankleyn](https://github.com/nathankleyn). I open-souce a lot of code, including this blog!
* I write for **[SitePoint.com](http://sitepoint.com)** about Ruby. You can [view my author profile](http://sitepoint.com/author/nkleyn) to see my articles.
