title: The Parable Of The Getting Started Experience
---

[This is the story of a boy named Stanley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8FzMI2KSTQ). Stanley had never written any code before, but he had always wanted to. His Dad worked for a company called "Google" where he programmed and it sounded like an amazing place to work! Stanley had always been interested in computers since a young age and had dreamed of being able to learn programming some day &mdash; plus, he sure liked the sound of free food, sleeping pods and [dinosaurs battling flamingos](http://boingboing.net/2014/07/25/on-google-campus-a-dinosaur-i.html).

Stanley decided to try to learn to code in his spare time. A quick search on the internet yielded plenty of results for courses he could take to get off on the right foot. He quickly determined that he wanted to learn how to make a website. After doing some reading, he discovered he would need to learn a language called "HTML". He enrolled in a course and set to work right away, his enthusiasm palpable. The possibilities were endless once he could make things like he'd seen on the internet!

After many days of working away trying to understand HTML, Stanley had made his first web page. It was very basic, but it was something! He was very proud of what he'd achieved, but he couldn't shake the want of making his website look more like the other websites he'd seen on the internet.

To make things pretty like those other websites, he did some research and discovered he would have to learn "CSS". Somewhat disappointed that he'd have to learn a whole new thing from scratch, he begun to delve into that next. He found the whole ordeal rather too much for a while; between having to learn what each property did and how to combine them to make his website look nice, he was starting to think he'd never be able to make a real website.

After many weeks of learning CSS, Stanley finally made his web pages looks pretty. It wasn't the most amazing creation, but it was something! He was very proud of what he'd achieved, but he couldn't dispose of the feeling that the other websites still had something his didn't. His website felt very static.

When he did some research, he found lots of tutorials throwing around words like "React" and "Angular" that made him want to give up for fear of being overwhelmed. He eventually found that underneath these two things lay a language called "JavaScript" which promised great things: being able to change the page after it loaded, do complex animations and script complex interactions with the user. He persisted and started looking into JavaScript. He questioned the need for a whole new language and set of tools to do this, but following instructions he set off to learn in the hope that he could make his website look and feel like the others.

After many months of absorbing book after book and video after video, he finally was able to embellish his website with JavaScript the way he'd seen others do. The website looked amazing, and page after page Stanley had poured his newfound knowledge into making the best website he could. There was, however, still something missing.

One evening Stanley sat down with his Dad after dinner. He showed him the website he had created and explained how he felt something was missing. He wondered how these other websites were able to allow people to write comments on their pages, or to have thousands of pages without having to change every single page one by one. Stanley's Dad explained that they were using "Server-Side Programming", a technique to build up the HTML from data by writing code.

Stanley, dreading having to read more books, asked his Dad if he could do this with JavaScript, HTML and CSS, the languages he'd already learned. Stanley's Dad walked over to the computer and typed into the search box "Node.js". Up popped a website full of new technology Stanley would have to get to grips with.

Stanley sighed, thanked his Dad, and got to work.
