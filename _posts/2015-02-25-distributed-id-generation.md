title: Distributed ID Generation
---

I presented a talk on distributed ID generation using Redis Lua scripting! The [slides are available on Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/nathankleyn/distributed-id-generation) and we're planning on open-sourcing our implementation from Intent HQ soon!

In the meantime, you might find this useful as a guide on the theory and ideas behind generating unique IDs in a distributed fashion.
