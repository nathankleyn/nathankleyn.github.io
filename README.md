# Hey There!

Hello GitHub traveller! This is the source code for [nathankleyn.com](https://nathankleyn.com), a blog which uses Jekyll and publishes to GitHub pages. Within this repository, you can find the source Markdown for all my blog posts, and the unminified CSS/SCSS for the theme I use.

## Colophon

Obviously, it goes without saying that I am using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/).

The theme for my blog is based heavily on Edward Tufte's [Tufte CSS](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/). However, rather than use that project directly, I have created a minimal version of it that suits my needs better — I found it relied too heavily on specific HTML tags to be useful in the context of the blog structure I had in mind.

I am using Solarized Light for the syntax highlighting of code, which you can [find the source of in a Gist here](https://gist.github.com/nicolashery/5765395). I had to make some tweaks to this at the time to get it to match the official colour palette, which now appear to have been done by others in the comments underneath.

The favicon was taken from [the Google Material Design icon collection](https://github.com/google/material-design-icons) — you can find [a better way to browse this collection at Material Palette](https://www.materialpalette.com/icons).
